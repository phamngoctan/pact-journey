My pact testing framework journey

## Run the Example

* Run `mvn integration-test` in the `consumer` subdirectory.
* Note that JSON Pact files were created in `consumer/target/PACTS`
* Copy json file in folder `/consumer/target/PACTS` to folder `/provider/src/test/resources/pacts` if you change contract of consumer. For example, change the path or change the property name.
* Run `mvn integration-test` in the `provider` subdirecty.
* Note that this test uses the JSON Pact files in `pact-example/provider/src/test/resources/pacts`.

So to change the contract the consumer team would change the tests in `consumer/src/test`. This would result in different Pact files. The consumer team would provide them to the provider team. That way the Pact file would be integrated in the `provider` project. The provider team needs to assure that the tests pass.
